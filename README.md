# YOLO
This folder contains the base algorithms for the various versions of yolo, implemented from scratch. The algorithms have been tested on real world datasets and have gained an average of 96% on testing datasets.
You Only Look Once (YOLO) deals with localizing a region of interest within an image and classifying this region like a typical image classifier. One image can include several regions of interest pointing to different objects. This makes object detection a more advanced problem of image classification.
YOLO is a popular object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It was first introduced by Joseph Redmon et al. in 2016 and has since undergone several iterations, the latest being YOLO v7.
